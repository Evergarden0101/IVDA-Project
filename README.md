# IVDA-Course

## Commit rules

- different folders for different modules
  - Frontend, backend...
- develop on own branch use **checkout**
  -  **yifan, yizhi, yunlong, alex**
- keep commits clean (once commit one function) and describe briefly what is updated
  - in case we need to look back to find bugs, so we can search commits
- Use merge request to merge your branch to **main**, and send the request  in group chat to let others know the update and check bugs
  - merge should be done after checking
- use meaningful variable names, regardless of the length.
- update .gitignore file to ignore changes
